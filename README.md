This repo contains the code and data of our ICASSP'2025 paper [Trusted Mamba Contrastive Network for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16487).

## 1. Abstract

Multi-view clustering can partition data samples into their categories by learning a consensus representation in an unsupervised way and has received more and more attention in recent years. However, there is an untrusted fusion problem. The reasons for this problem are as follows: 1) The current methods ignore the presence of noise or redundant information in the view; 2) The similarity of contrastive learning comes from the same sample rather than the same cluster in deep multi-view clustering. It causes multi-view fusion in the wrong direction. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering network to address this problem, termed as Trusted Mamba Contrastive Network (TMCN). Specifically, we present a new Trusted Mamba Fusion Network (TMFN), which achieves a trusted fusion of multi-view data through a selective mechanism. Moreover, we align the fused representation and the view-specific representation using the Average-similarity Contrastive Learning (AsCL) module. AsCL increases the similarity of view presentation from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.
